The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes. The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner. The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes. This means that PATCHes are bug fixes and MINORs add new features but neither of them break what worked before. Finally, MAJORs add changes that wonâ€™t work with earlier versions.
